Youki Katsujishotai is a TrueType font with embedded color images, like character fonts, except instead of character it contains flat-style sprites of Youki characters. The version named **YoukiKatsujishotai.ttf.sbix.ttf** works only with Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or later. The version named **YoukiKatsujishotai.ttf.svg.ttf** will work with Mozilla Firefox and will soon work with Adobe CC and Windows 10/11.

Katsujishotai (hiragana: かつじしょたい, kanji: 活字書体) means "typeface" according to EDICT.

The font was generated by FontForge, but since FontForge does not support embedded color images, they had to be injected into the generated font using [Kreative BitsNPicas](https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas).
